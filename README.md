# Sea Monster Alert

This mod adds visual and audio notice when the rare [green sea creature](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secrets#Beach_Creature) appears at the beach. Created for the winter 2023 Stardew Discord team event. 

Config options:
* `doBeachWarp`: warps you to the beach in front of Willy's shop at the start of the day
* `doScream`: adds the shrieking bat sound effect when the sea monster appears
* `showMessage`: adds an onscreen alert message when the sea monster appears
* `takeScreenshot`: automatically takes a screenshot of the beach when the sea monster appears (adds a small lag spike when it takes the screenshot)
* `forceSpawn`: forces the sea monster to spawn (for testing purposes)
